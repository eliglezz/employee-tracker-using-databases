Database to store employees along with departments, roles, and manager options. Runs in terminal and uses mysql to store employees to database and uses the inquirer node package to collect the users information.
## Installation
Fork the repo, Clone the repo. Run `npm i` in the terminal to get the necessary packages. After all packages are installed open mysql, run schema with `source db/schemea.sql`, seed the database with `source db/seeds.sql`, then exit mysql. Now in the terminal run `node index.js` and Inquirer should start right up. Do not run mysql commands if data is already added as this will delete any information you added<br>
